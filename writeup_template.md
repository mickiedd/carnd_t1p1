The goals / steps of this project are the following:

### Pipline

First grayscale the image

And then apply Gaussian Blur to the image

And then apply this blur and gray image to  Canny

And then define a region of interest for the image

And then mask this image by this region of interest

And then run Hough one this masked image, this step will return a group of lines found, apply this lines to a blank image

At last Mix the blank-with-lines-image and the original image together, output a Lane-image

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ...
